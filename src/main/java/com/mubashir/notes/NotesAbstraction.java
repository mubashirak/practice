	2.Abstract method doesnt have body it's just a declaration.
	3.Use abstraction only if know something needs to be in class but implementation would vary.
	you cannot create instance of abstract class by new()
	4.Abstract class can have constructor
	5.Abstract is a keyword which can be used with class and method.
	6.Abstract class can have both abstract and concrete method
	7.class automatically becomes abstract if one of its method is made abstract.
